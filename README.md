# Cooler-System-ATmega32

## Description
A sensor measures temperature & if it’s greater than 35°c, a cooler starts running. When the temperature increases, the motor’s speed increases.

## Details
- Cooler, buzzer and LED will be on when temperature is more than 35°c and off when less than 35°c.
- Temperature should be appeared on LCD first row and also in seven-seg.
- Cooler speed (duty cycle) should be appeared in second row.
- Cooler system is consists of 5volt DC motor, when the range of temperature is from 35c to 50c the cooler Dc volt should be from 2.5 to 5 volt.
- Temperature range captured by the sensor is from 20°c to 50°c.
